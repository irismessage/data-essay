good customer pay back loan and keeps doing business
bad customer doesn't pay loan and leaves the bank - y
business problem: understanding customers

think about whether the  customer base is aging

- identify good customer and give them a free holiday or vodaphone or whatever banks do
- make bar chart from standard vernacular generations of millennial, boomer, gen x balance, transaction count, loans etc.
- consider proportion of customers recruited from each region
- linear regreggion of num. entrepreneurs to num. loans, unemployement?

think about more data analysis not just useful modelling

say "leverage" a bunch
tips for bad exams: do repeat yourself. keep it complex smartass

make assumption about cessation of transactions meaning leaving the bank
