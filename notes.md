good customer pay back loan and keeps doing business
bad customer doesn't pay loan and leaves the bank - y
business problem: understanding customers

think about whether the  customer base is aging

- identify good customer and give them a free holiday or vodaphone or whatever banks do
- make bar chart from standard vernacular generations of millennial, boomer, gen x balance, transaction count, loans etc.
- consider proportion of customers recruited from each region
- linear regreggion of num. entrepreneurs to num. loans, unemployement?

think about more data analysis not just useful modelling

say "leverage" a bunch
tips for bad exams: do repeat yourself. keep it complex smartass

make assumption about cessation of transactions meaning leaving the bank


- google "what does a bank want" "how do banks make money"
- could it be they've hidden a puzzle in the data? something specific we're intended to find?
    - nope, it's stock

[x] check if any disponent is involved in other tables, not owner
    - seemingly not really but whatever
[x] see if I need to include cardID in BankTransaction
    - nope

how the , for example, do they expect me to do analysis on customer retention when there's zero data on customers LEAVING??
