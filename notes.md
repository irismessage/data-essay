good customer pay back loan and keeps doing business
bad customer doesn't pay loan and leaves the bank - y
business problem: understanding customers

think about whether the  customer base is aging

- logistic regression of loan default
    - done
    - do writeup
- identify good customer and give them a free holiday or vodaphone or whatever banks do
    - ?
    - find average time staying with bank for population
    - find average time for diff. credit cards users
    - apply z-equation
- make bar chart from standard vernacular generations of millennial, boomer, gen x balance, transaction count, loans etc.
    - assign each client row generation column
    - groupby aggregate functions on them
- consider proportion of customers recruited from each region in a similar way to generations
- linear regreggion of num. entrepreneurs to num. loans, unemployement?

think about more data analysis not just useful modelling

say "leverage" a bunch
tips for bad exams: do repeat yourself. keep it complex smartass

make assumption about cessation of transactions meaning leaving the bank


- google "what does a bank want" "how do banks make money"
- could it be they've hidden a puzzle in the data? something specific we're intended to find?
    - nope, it's stock

[x] check if any disponent is involved in other tables, not owner
    - seemingly not really but whatever
[x] see if I need to include cardID in BankTransaction
    - nope

how the , for example, do they expect me to do analysis on customer retention when there's zero data on customers LEAVING??

# find the average of birthdate or whatever
# I don't know WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME

# well, keep slogging at it and something will come to me even if I can't see it now

# idea: group transacitons by credit card type. for customer retention stuff

don't know if I'll get great closure on this until the deadline passes and I can't add anymore :/ cause it's so bs vague
meh I'm kinda close to 40 already

try adding what banks a customer makes transfers to to models
won't add any value at this point

hey this is easy
have all the ideas I need to just have to implement
then finally waffle

EVIL DIES TONIGHT
I *will feel closure after I write the last word of mu conclusion!!
